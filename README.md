# The Project of Estimating the Political Opinions of the Turkish People

In this project, I developed classification models to predict the political opinions of Turkish people. 
The primary objective of the project is to adopt an approach that can be practically applied and effectively managed in real-life scenarios.

## Project Description

The project was developed by following the steps outlined below:

1. **Dataset Selection**: Initially, I utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle.com. However, I determined that the dataset had limitations and could potentially provide misleading results.

2. **Creating a Google Form**: I created [a google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzatWes3vOafZreTRKMuGLVu4SW93-vWBZhTF7I2I9If4yyQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to gather other political opinions

3. **Data Retrieval and Processing**: I automatically retrieved Google Form data through the use of the Google API (APIgoogle.py), and then I stored this data in the "googleAPI.csv" file.

4. **Model Training**: I trained classification models using the collected dataset. These models encompass classification algorithms capable of predicting political views.

5. **Model Testing and Development**: Upon running the project, you can enhance the model using real-world data by entering your own responses.

6. **Continuous Improvement**:As time goes on and new data is added, the model continuously improves itself.. This enables the model to enhance its accuracy and precision in making predictions over time.

This project embodies a data-driven approach toward comprehending and projecting the political views of the Turkish public.
